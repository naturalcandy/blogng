## A little more about me

I'm a Boston native who grew up with a love for technology. It all started when I was just 10 years old and started programming Python macro scripts to level up my gaming skills. Since then, I've been on an exciting journey of learning and growth.

Recently, my interests have expanded to encompass systems programming and finance. However, what surprises many is that my favorite classes at CMU have been those focused on functional programming. All of which have opened my mind to a new way of approaching programming. I'm captivated by its mathematical provability and the elegance it brings to problem-solving. Excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, I am motivated to utilize collaboration and computation to tackle real-world challenges and drive impactful solutions.

When I'm not immersed in tech, I pursue my other passions. Wrestling became a significant part of my high school years, teaching me discipline and resilience. Today, I continue to challenge myself physically and mentally as a member of the CMU Jujitsu Club.

In my downtime, I find joy in cooking. It's a creative outlet that allows me to craft delicious dishes and share memorable moments with others.

Beyond my technical pursuits and hobbies, I actively contribute to ColorStack at CMU. As a person of color, I recognize the importance of diversity and representation in the tech industry. Through ColorStack, I work towards fostering inclusivity and creating opportunities for underrepresented communitiesâ€”a cause that deeply resonates with me.

So, that's a little glimpse into who I am. I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and adventures with you through this blog!
